      " |  \n",
      " |  `antsRegistration <http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/>`_ registers a ``moving_image`` to a ``fixed_image``,\n",
      " |  using a predefined (sequence of) cost function(s) and transformation operations.\n",
      " |  The cost function is defined using one or more 'metrics', specifically\n",
      " |  local cross-correlation (``CC``), Mean Squares (``MeanSquares``), Demons (``Demons``),\n",
      " |  global correlation (``GC``), or Mutual Information (``Mattes`` or ``MI``).\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  ANTS can use both linear (``Translation``, ``Rigid``, ``Affine``, ``CompositeAffine``,\n",
      " |  or ``Translation``) and non-linear transformations (``BSpline``, ``GaussianDisplacementField``,\n",
      " |  ``TimeVaryingVelocityField``, ``TimeVaryingBSplineVelocityField``, ``SyN``, ``BSplineSyN``,\n",
      " |  ``Exponential``, or ``BSplineExponential``). Usually, registration is done in multiple\n",
      " |  *stages*. For example first an Affine, then a Rigid, and ultimately a non-linear\n",
      " |  (Syn)-transformation.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  antsRegistration can be initialized using one or more transforms from moving_image\n",
      " |  to fixed_image with the ``initial_moving_transform``-input. For example, when you\n",
      " |  already have a warpfield that corrects for geometrical distortions in an EPI (functional) image,\n",
      " |  that you want to apply before an Affine registration to a structural image.\n",
      " |  You could put this transform into 'intial_moving_transform'.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  The Registration-interface can output the resulting transform(s) that map moving_image to\n",
      " |  fixed_image in a single file as a ``composite_transform`` (if ``write_composite_transform``\n",
      " |  is set to ``True``), or a list of transforms as ``forwards_transforms``. It can also output\n",
      " |  inverse transforms (from ``fixed_image`` to ``moving_image``) in a similar fashion using\n",
      " |  ``inverse_composite_transform``. Note that the order of ``forward_transforms`` is in 'natural'\n",
      " |  order: the first element should be applied first, the last element should be applied last.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  Note, however, that ANTS tools always apply lists of transformations in reverse order (the last\n",
      " |  transformation in the list is applied first). Therefore, if the output forward_transforms\n",
      " |  is a list, one can not directly feed it into, for example, ``ants.ApplyTransforms``. To\n",
      " |  make ``ants.ApplyTransforms`` apply the transformations in the same order as ``ants.Registration``,\n",
      " |  you have to provide the list of transformations in reverse order from ``forward_transforms``.\n",
      " |  ``reverse_forward_transforms`` outputs ``forward_transforms`` in reverse order and can be used for\n",
      " |  this purpose. Note also that, because ``composite_transform`` is always a single file, this\n",
